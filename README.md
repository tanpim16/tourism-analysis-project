## **Introduction** ##

Tourism is one of the most important drivers of Thailand’s economy, contributing significantly to national income, employment, and regional economic activity. Tourism revenue accounts for a substantial share of Thailand’s gross domestic product and plays a key role in supporting economic recovery through foreign exchange earnings and service-sector employment (World Bank, 2023). In addition to its direct contribution, tourism generates multiplier effects across related industries such as transportation, accommodation, food services, and local enterprises, thereby supporting community livelihoods and regional development (Lloyds Bank, 2024).

However, tourism development in Thailand has historically been concentrated in major destinations, leading to unequal distribution of economic benefits across regions. To reduce regional disparities, the Thai government introduced the secondary-city tourism (เมืองรอง) policy, aiming to redistribute tourist flows toward lesser-visited provinces and promote inclusive local economic growth through community-based tourism and regional promotion strategies (Chulalongkorn University, 2020).

Despite increasing tourism promotion and visitor growth in secondary cities, it remains unclear whether tourism expansion translates into real economic improvement for local communities. Increased tourist arrivals may not necessarily lead to higher real income if benefits are unevenly distributed or offset by rising living costs. Therefore, this study examines whether secondary-city tourism contributes to real income generation and more balanced regional development in Thailand.

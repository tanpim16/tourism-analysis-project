## **Research Questions**
This study addresses the following research questions:
1. Do secondary cities experience higher tourist growth rates than primary destinations during 2023–2025?
2. Has tourism policy contributed to the redistribution of tourists toward secondary cities?
3. Does tourism development improve income quality, measured by revenue per tourist and international visitor share?
4. Can online search interest predict tourism demand and tourism revenue?
5. Does tourism growth generate real income gains for local communities after adjusting for inflation?

## **Introduction** ##

Tourism is one of the most important drivers of Thailand’s economy, contributing significantly to national income, employment, and regional economic activity. Tourism revenue accounts for a substantial share of Thailand’s gross domestic product and plays a key role in supporting economic recovery through foreign exchange earnings and service-sector employment (World Bank, 2023). In addition to its direct contribution, tourism generates multiplier effects across related industries such as transportation, accommodation, food services, and local enterprises, thereby supporting community livelihoods and regional development (Lloyds Bank, 2024).

However, tourism development in Thailand has historically been concentrated in major destinations, leading to unequal distribution of economic benefits across regions. To reduce regional disparities, the Thai government introduced the secondary-city tourism (เมืองรอง) policy, aiming to redistribute tourist flows toward lesser-visited provinces and promote inclusive local economic growth through community-based tourism and regional promotion strategies (Chulalongkorn University, 2020).

Despite increasing tourism promotion and visitor growth in secondary cities, it remains unclear whether tourism expansion translates into real economic improvement for local communities. Increased tourist arrivals may not necessarily lead to higher real income if benefits are unevenly distributed or offset by rising living costs. Therefore, this study examines whether secondary-city tourism contributes to real income generation and more balanced regional development in Thailand.

## **Economic Growth of Primary Cities vs Secondary Cities Tourism** ##

### **Tourism Trends** ###

Tourism represents an important source of economic activity across provinces in Thailand, although its contribution may differ between primary and secondary destinations. While primary cities have traditionally served as established tourism centers, secondary cities have increasingly been promoted as alternative destinations under national tourism policies. 

Examining trends in tourism performance across these two groups is therefore important for identifying emerging patterns and assesing the potential for broader tourism development. Observing changes in both tourist arrivals and tourism income over time allows for an evaluation of whether growth in secondary cities signals expanding economic opportunities and increasing participation in the tourism economy. By comparing these trends, the analysis provides insight into how tourism dynamics evolve across provinces and helps reveal the potential for secondary destinations to strengthen their economic role within Thailand’s tourism sector.

#Figure 1B: Monthly Tourism Income Trend (2023–2025)#

Figure 1 presents tourism dynamics through two dimensions: tourist arrivals (Figure 1A) and tourism income (Figure 1B). The results show a clear upward trend in tourist arrivals for both primary and secondary cities during 2023–2025. Secondary cities experienced steady growth and displayed seasonal patterns similar to primary destinations, particularly during peak tourism periods at the beginning and end of each year.

Tourism income also increased over time; however, the magnitude of revenue growth in secondary cities remained considerably lower than in primary cities. While visitor numbers expanded in secondary destinations, income gains did not increase proportionally, indicating a persistent gap in tourism value generation.

The findings suggest that Thailand’s secondary-city tourism policy has been effective in stimulating tourist movement toward lesser-visited provinces. The similarity in seasonal patterns implies stronger integration of secondary cities into national tourism demand. Nevertheless, the weaker income response shown in Axes B indicates that increased visitor numbers alone may not ensure equivalent economic benefits. Differences in tourist spending behavior, service quality, and tourism infrastructure may limit revenue capture in secondary destinations. Therefore, tourism redistribution appears to occur primarily in terms of visitor volume rather than economic value.

### **2025 Torism Income Growth Rate** ###


#Figure 2 illustrates the monthly year-over-year (YoY) growth rate of tourism income in primary and secondary cities.#


The Year-over-Year (YoY) tourism income growth in 2025 shows a clear moderation compared with the strong expansion observed in 2024. Tourism income growth in primary cities declined from approximately 15.00%–30.00% in early 2024 to levels close to 0.00% at the beginning of 2025. During the middle of the year, several months recorded negative growth ranging between –5.00% and –10.00%, indicating that monthly tourism revenue was slightly lower than in the corresponding months of the previous year.

In contrast, secondary cities maintained mostly positive YoY income growth throughout 2025, generally fluctuating between 3.00% and 10.00%. The variation in growth rates was smaller compared with primary cities, suggesting more stable changes in tourism income over time.


The observed slowdown in YoY income growth in primary cities can be explained mainly by a base-year effect. High tourism revenue recorded in 2024 raised the comparison benchmark, causing growth rates in 2025 to appear lower even when income levels remained relatively stable. Therefore, negative YoY values should be interpreted as a normalization of growth rather than a decline in tourism activity.

Meanwhile, the continued positive growth in secondary cities indicates ongoing expansion, although at a moderate pace. The lower volatility observed in these areas suggests gradual development rather than rapid fluctuation. From a data analytics perspective, the comparison highlights differences in growth stages between city groups: primary cities appear to be entering a stabilization phase, while secondary cities continue to show incremental growth potential. These results emphasize the importance of interpreting YoY indicators alongside trend behavior and baseline effects when analyzing time-series economic data.

## **Introduction** ##

Tourism is one of the most important drivers of Thailand’s economy, contributing significantly to national income, employment, and regional economic activity. Tourism revenue accounts for a substantial share of Thailand’s gross domestic product and plays a key role in supporting economic recovery through foreign exchange earnings and service-sector employment (World Bank, 2023). In addition to its direct contribution, tourism generates multiplier effects across related industries such as transportation, accommodation, food services, and local enterprises, thereby supporting community livelihoods and regional development (Lloyds Bank, 2024).

However, tourism development in Thailand has historically been concentrated in major destinations, leading to unequal distribution of economic benefits across regions. To reduce regional disparities, the Thai government introduced the secondary-city tourism (เมืองรอง) policy, aiming to redistribute tourist flows toward lesser-visited provinces and promote inclusive local economic growth through community-based tourism and regional promotion strategies (Chulalongkorn University, 2020).

Despite increasing tourism promotion and visitor growth in secondary cities, it remains unclear whether tourism expansion translates into real economic improvement for local communities. Increased tourist arrivals may not necessarily lead to higher real income if benefits are unevenly distributed or offset by rising living costs. Therefore, this study examines whether secondary-city tourism contributes to real income generation and more balanced regional development in Thailand.

## **Economic Contribution of Primary Cities vs Secondary Cities Tourism** ##

Tourism represents an important source of economic activity across different regions of Thailand, yet its contribution may vary between primary and secondary destinations. Primary cities have traditionally served as the main tourism hubs due to established infrastructure, accessibility, and a concentration of tourism services, while secondary cities have increasingly been promoted as alternative destinations under national tourism policies.

Examining the economic contribution of tourism across these two groups is important for understanding whether the expansion of tourism activity is accompanied by changes in the distribution of tourism-generated income. Differences may arise not only in visitor volumes but also in revenue generation, spending patterns, and the overall economic value created within local economies.

Therefore, comparing tourism performance between primary and secondary cities provides a basis for assessing how tourism growth evolves across regions and whether shifts in tourist flows are associated with broader changes in economic outcomes. The following analysis explores these patterns using indicators of tourist arrivals and tourism income over time.

#Figure 1:#

Figure 1 presents tourism dynamics through two dimensions: tourist arrivals (Axes A) and tourism income (Axes B). The results show a clear upward trend in tourist arrivals for both primary and secondary cities during 2023–2025. Secondary cities experienced steady growth and displayed seasonal patterns similar to primary destinations, particularly during peak tourism periods at the beginning and end of each year.

Tourism income also increased over time; however, the magnitude of revenue growth in secondary cities remained considerably lower than in primary cities. While visitor numbers expanded in secondary destinations, income gains did not increase proportionally, indicating a persistent gap in tourism value generation.

The findings suggest that Thailand’s secondary-city tourism policy has been effective in stimulating tourist movement toward lesser-visited provinces. The similarity in seasonal patterns implies stronger integration of secondary cities into national tourism demand. Nevertheless, the weaker income response shown in Axes B indicates that increased visitor numbers alone may not ensure equivalent economic benefits. Differences in tourist spending behavior, service quality, and tourism infrastructure may limit revenue capture in secondary destinations. Therefore, tourism redistribution appears to occur primarily in terms of visitor volume rather than economic value.
